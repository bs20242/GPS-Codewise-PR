CodeWise aims to optimize the code review process in software projects, reducing the time spent on manual reviews and increasing the quality of the code delivered by development teams.

It works in an integrated way with GitHub, automatically analyzing Pull Requests through generative language models. The solution identifies architectural improvements, possible code smells, violations of S.O.L.I.D. principles, and suggests appropriate design patterns. Additionally, it is capable of generating automatic PR titles and descriptions, contributing to clearer and more standardized documentation.

The tool will be available as a library, installable via pip, and will feature integration hooks to act directly within repositories. Its central proposal is to reduce the manual effort of reviewers, standardize code architecture, and make the development process more efficient and sustainable.
